        I&#39;m a passionate software developer, an eternal optimist, and an
        avid builder residing in the heart of Ottawa, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. Born and raised
        in the beautiful landscapes of Burundi ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡®, I carry the vibrant spirit of
        my homeland wherever I go, aiming to bridge cultures through technology.
        I thrive on innovation, constantly seeking out new challenges and
        technologies that can enhance our lives. My journey in technology is
        fueled by a deep desire to learn and grow, always pushing the boundaries
        of what&apos;s possible. As an active contributor to open-source
        projects, I believe in the power of collaboration and the open exchange
        of ideas to drive progress. Music, sports, and football, particularly my
        unwavering support for Arsenal FC, keep me energized and inspired. I see
        beauty in diversity, which is why my AI, Juwiragiye, is a reflection of
        my commitment to inclusivity. Developed to converse in Kirundi and other
        local languages, Juwiragiye is designed to spark creativity and inspire
        users across different cultures.
