        hey, I&#39;m Janvier 👋

        <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
          I&#39;m a passionate software developer, an eternal optimist, and an
          avid builder residing in the heart of Ottawa, Canada 🇨🇦. Born and
          raised in the beautiful landscapes of Burundi 🇧🇮, I carry the vibrant
          spirit of my homeland wherever I go, aiming to bridge cultures through
          technology. I thrive on innovation, constantly seeking out new
          challenges and technologies that can enhance our lives. My journey in
          technology is fueled by a deep desire to learn and grow, always
          pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s possible. As an active
          contributor to open-source projects, I believe in the power of
          collaboration and the open exchange of ideas to drive progress. Music,
          sports, and football, particularly my unwavering support for Arsenal
          FC, keep me energized and inspired. I see beauty in diversity, which
          is why my AI, Juwiragiye, is a reflection of my commitment to
          inclusivity. Developed to converse in Kirundi and other local
          languages, Juwiragiye is designed to spark creativity and inspire
          users across different cultures.
